This is a masked face classifier: it frames faces with masks in green and without in red

The solution consists of:
  1. searching for faces with a built-in function (works well with masks on too)
  2. detecting on each face a mask
    - detecting a white spot with a max of global face histogram near white(255 for each color-channel)
    - ignoring too dark images
    - detecting lips with a built-in function
    - other than that, a template of a blue mask may be matched(if given to function)
  3. framing faces
  
There are some ideas in improving the solution: normalize input pictures and finishing template-implementation
Also, searching for eyes and cropping a face using them only
